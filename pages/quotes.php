		<p>"U-TOUCH Uganda in partnership with Peaceconferencing process with teams at the
U-TOUCH Digital Library Centers (DLCs) in northern Uganda.  Teams are comprised of students who lived through the insurgency of the 20-year Lordâ€™s Resistance Army (LRA) War.  Living in extreme poverty, on less than $1 per day, without running water or electricity living in isolation the people of northern Uganda lost hope for their future. U-TOUCH, partnering with AMREF, a Ugandan non-governmental organization, in 2010 began operations in developing U-TOUCH Digital Library Centers, bringing technology, training and the Internet to bridge the digital divide and advance the livelihoods and the economic conditions of the rural villages in Uganda. Through the U-TOUCH Centers, Peaceconferencing has become integral in problem solving the real issues facing the people living in the aftermath of two decades of conflict.  Peaceconferencing is an innovative tool, training conflict resolution and communication skills to prevent or attenuate future altercations.  Using technology the people of northern Uganda have the opportunity to gain invaluable interactive life skills through the Peaceconferencing process.    "</p>
