	<div style="width: 500px; float: left;" ><p>Sea Change Simulations, LLC exists to help bring role play back to the classroom, and to  keep it realistic and relevant in today’s highly networked, world of instant communication. They are the world’s only provider of an open source platform that enables ‘Technology Enhanced Role Plays’ or TERPs. The members of Sea Change Simulations believe strongly that people learn more, and learn far more deeply, when they are immersed in a simulated reality where their decisions have consequences. Their platform enables everyone to easily create, conduct, play in or share a TERP.</p>

U-TOUCH Digital Library Centers (DLCs) in northern Uganda.  Teams are comprised of students who lived through the insurgency of the 20-year Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) War.  Living in extreme poverty, on less than $1 per day, without running water or electricity in isolation the people of northern Uganda lost hope for their future. U-TOUCH, partnering with AMREF, a Ugandan non-governmental organization, in 2010 began operations in developing U-TOUCH Digital Library Centers, bringing technology, training and the Internet to bridge the digital divide and advance the livelihoods and the economic conditions of the rural villages in Uganda. Through the U-TOUCH Centers, Peaceconferencing has become integral in problem solving the real issues facing the people living in the aftermath of two decades of conflict including, education, water and sanitation, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health care, gender based violence and tobacco control.  Peaceconferencing is an innovative tool, training conflict resolution and communication skills to prevent or attenuate future altercations.  Using technology the people of northern Uganda have the opportunity to gain invaluable interactive life skills through the Peaceconferencing process.    </p>
