	<h3>About Peaceconferencing</h3>
	<p>The concept of teaching peaceful negotiation strategies to high school students originated at the Bishop’s School in La Jolla, California as a direct result of the classroom experience during and immediately after the events of 9-11. Students turned to the internet, their medium for information, to understand the dynamic stream of events that was tragically unfolding. They needed a methodology to access the internet in “real time” as events happened and more importantly, they needed a sense of hope that global conflict would not always spin into further escalation.

		<br />
	Student teams supported through an open simulation platform studied current real-world conflicts to target one flashpoint area that held particular urgency for the group. A student mediator was selected to bring students, each representing an opposition group, to the negotiation table.  
		<br />
		<br />
	Their collaborative efforts produced peace agreements based on consensus that were sensitive to the needs and fears of the parties in conflict and offered hope for resolution through diplomacy. 
		<br />
		<br />
	Peaceconferencing has now expanded to partnership schools in the United States and Northern Uganda through digital library centers.
